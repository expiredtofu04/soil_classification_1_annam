# Soil Classification 
🌱 Soil Classification using CNN | Annam.ai IIT Ropar Challenge 2025

This repository contains a deep learning solution for the Soil Image Classification Challenge hosted by Annam.ai at IIT Ropar. The objective is to accurately classify soil images into four categories: Alluvial Soil, Black Soil, Clay Soil, and Red Soil. The model leverages a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized to maximize the minimum F1-score across all classes. It includes:

📁 Preprocessing pipeline and EDA

🧠 CNN model implementation with regularization

📊 Evaluation using F1-score

📤 Submission file generator

⏱️ Runtime-efficient code (under 30 minutes)

🧪 Count of soil vs non-soil images

This repository is designed for reproducibility, performance, and submission-readiness.
